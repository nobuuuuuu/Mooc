### V. React and RESTful API

This part is a plus and will help you to optimize your application and the possibility to add more. The RESTful API is use by lot of application because this method proposes different advantages. But which advantages can we get with the RESTful API? First of all, we can see what a RESTful API is. 

#### a. What a RESTful API is ?

A REST API (also called a RESTful API) is an application programming interface that respects the constraints of the REST (for “Representational State Transfer”) architecture.

An API, or application programming interface, is a set of definitions and protocols that facilitate the creation and integration of application software. It is sometimes seen as a contract between an information provider and an information user, which defines the content requested from the consumer (the call) and the content requested from the producer (the response). For example, a weather service API might ask the user to provide a zip code and the producer to return a two-part response: the first for the maximum temperature and the second for the minimum temperature.

In other words, when you want to interact with a computer or system to retrieve information or perform a function, an API allows you to tell the system what you want from it, so that it can understand your request and do it. reply.

You can think of an API as a mediator between users, or customers, and the resources they want to access. For a company, it is also a solution to share resources and information, while ensuring security and a certain level of control, determining who is authorized to access and to what.

Another advantage of APIs is that you don't need to know exactly how your resources are being retrieved or where they are coming from.

REST is a set of architectural principles. It is neither a protocol nor a standard. API developers can implement REST in a number of ways.

When a request is made through a RESTful API, the API transfers a representation of the state of the resource to the requestor. This information, or representation, is provided over the HTTP protocol in one of the following formats: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), HTML, XLT, or plain text. The most commonly used format is JSON because, as the name does not suggest, it is not language dependent and can be read by both humans and machines.

A RESTful API must meet the following criteria:

A client-server architecture made up of clients, servers and resources, with requests managed via HTTP
Stateless client-server communications, i.e. client information is never stored between requests, which must be handled separately, completely independently
The ability to cache data to streamline client-server interactions
A uniform interface between the components which allows a standardized transfer of information This implies that:
the requested resources are identifiable and separate from the representations sent to the client;
the resources can be manipulated by the client by means of the received representation, which contains sufficient information;
the self-describing messages returned to the client contain enough detail to describe how the client should handle the information;
the API has hypermedia, which allows the client to use hyperlinks to know all the other actions available after accessing a resource.
A layered system, invisible to the customer, which enables the different types of servers (for security, load balancing, etc.) involved in retrieving the requested information to be prioritized.
On-demand code (optional), i.e. the ability to send executable code from the server to the client (when it requests it) in order to extend the functionality of a client
Although the REST API must meet all of these criteria, it is considered to be easier to use than a protocol such as SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), which is subject to specific constraints including XML messaging. , integrated security and transaction compliance, which makes it heavier and slower.


#### b. Setup the project

##### Preconditions:
 * Node.js version 10.16.0 installed on your computer. To install it on macOS or Ubuntu 18.04, follow the steps of the tutorial How to install Node.js and create a local development environment on macOS or the * Installation using a PPA * section of the tutorial How to install Node.js on Ubuntu 18.04.
 * A new React project set up with Create React App by following the tutorial How to set up a React project with Create React App.
 * It will also be helpful to have a basic understanding of JavaScript, which you can find in the How to Code in JavaScript series, as well as a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.

###### Step 1:
In this section, you will add Axios to the React digital-ocean-tutorial project that you created by following the How to set up a React project with Create React App tutorial.

To add Axios to the project, open your terminal and change directory in your project:

```bash
cd digital-ocean-tutorial
```

Then run this command to install Axios:

```bash
npm install axios
```

# Chapter 1

Then you will need to import Axios to the file where you want to use it.

###### Step 2: Build the GET request

In this example, you create a new component and import Axios into it to send a GET request.

In the src folder of your React project, create a new component named PersonList.js:

```bash
nano src/PersonList.js
```


Add the following code to the component:

*Project/src/PersonList.js*

```js
import React from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

export default class PersonList extends React.Component {
  state = {
    persons: []
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    axios.get(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`)
      .then(res => {
        const persons = res.data;
        this.setState({ persons });
      })
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <ul>
        { this.state.persons.map(person => <li>{person.name}</li>)}
      </ul>
    )
  }
}
```

###### Client-server separation

One of the standards of REST is the separation of client and server. We touched on the issue of clients and servers a bit in the previous chapter, it's time to dig deeper!

A client is the one who will use the API. It can be an application, browser, or software. For example: As a developer, you might be using the Twitter API. As I said before, a client can also be software or a browser, whether it's Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. When a browser visits twitter.com, it makes a request to the Twitter API and uses the data from the API so that you can access the latest tweets.

Generally speaking, there is a separation between the client and the server. This separation allows the client to be concerned only with retrieving and displaying information, and allows the server to concentrate on storing and manipulating data. Everyone has their own role!

REST APIs provide a standardized means of communication between client and data. Basically, it doesn't matter how the server is built or how the client is coded, as long as they both structure their communication according to REST architectural guidelines, using the HTTP protocol, they will be able to communicate with each other! 

This is especially useful when large teams of developers are working on a single application. You can have one team working independently on the backend while the other works on the frontend. As the REST API communicates between the two, it makes it easier for developers to scale applications and for teams to work more efficiently. 

###### Stateless

One of the other unique aspects of REST APIs is that they are stateless which means that the server does not save any of the previous requests or responses.

###### Others

 * Easier to implement than the classic alternatives (we are not talking about WebSockets).
 * All you need is a browser to access a service.
 * Caching of resources, therefore speeding up operations.
 * Less memory consumption.
 * Possibility of distributing requests on several servers. This thanks to the absence of states.
 * The use of standard formats such as HTML or XML ensures compatibility over time.
 * You can exchange requests between various applications or media because they are represented by URIs.
